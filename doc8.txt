Based on an idea first pitched by Knoll, 10 years before it entered development, the film was made to be different in tone and style from the traditional Star Wars films, including omitting the customary opening crawl and transitional screen wipes. Principal photography on the film began at Elstree Studios near London in early August 2015 and wrapped in February 2016. The film then went through extensive reshoots and additional filming in mid-June 2016, with Gilroy acting as director of them. The film premiered in Los Angeles on December 10, 2016 and was released in the United States on December 16, 2016.

In late November 2016, box office projections for the United States and Canada had the film grossing $100–150 million during its opening weekend.[129][130] Disney chairman Bob Iger noted that Disney and Lucasfilm did not expect Rogue One to match The Force Awakens' total gross of $2.1 billion, nor its $248 million opening.[131] Pre-sale tickets for the film went on sale at 12:01 AM EST on November 28, 2016. Within 10 minutes, ticket sale sites such as Fandango crashed, much like they had in advance of The Force Awakens the year prior.[132] In its first 24 hours, the film had the second-highest number of pre-sale tickets ever sold, behind only The Force Awakens.[133] Worldwide, the film was expected to gross $280–350 million in its opening weekend.
