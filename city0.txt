The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.

Natural hazard and emergency services

As a highly vulnerable city to major natural disasters, Mumbai has experienced several major extreme weather events within the past decade that have effectively brought the city to a standstill and caused severe human and economic losses. In response to the growing need for a contingency plan, the city of Mumbai drafted the Disaster Risk Management Master Plan that outlines the city's commitment to mitigating future risk and damages that could potentially result through future natural disasters. 

It was determined that three factors led to the scale of the disaster: an antiquated storm-water drainage system, uncontrolled and unplanned development in the northern suburbs, and the destruction of mangrove ecosystems. As a result, the 2005 DRM plan was designed to reduce the impact of future extreme weather events. Massive public works projects were established to help reduce the risk of the city to future floods and the consequences of such events. The plan also outlined steps to protect human health before, during and after these extreme weather events to help combat the spread of communicable diseases around the city. In addition, the plan also included the enhancement of advanced monitoring and warning systems that would alert Mumbai's population of nearly 13 million of impending disasters. Many of these projects are already being implemented. Mumbai to have a world class emergency service system up and running very soon.



Public transport

Mumbai is stretched North to South and it as two railway lines running along its longer sides: Western Line along the west coast and Central Line along the eastern edge. The two lines meet at Dadar station.

Besides these two there are smaller lines such as the Harbour Line. Local trains are frequent during the day (every 2-5 minutes) and run till 12.30 - 1 am midnight. starting at 4.30 am in the morning.

Trains are the fastest and cheapest mode of transport but very very crowded and all of the tourist spots are far away from the railway lines, not recomended for tourists.

There are two types of taxis - (1) Black and yellow color  non-air-conditioned (2) Blue and silver color air-conditioned. Both have meters and it is compulsorily to use them. AC taxis cost about 25% more than the non-AC ones. All old and shabby non AC taxis over 15 years of age are phased out by the Government. Now all non AC taxis have an electronic meter which shows the exact amount of money you need to pay the driver which is Rs.21 for the first 1.5 km and subsequently Rs.12.35 for every km. There are quite a few on-call taxis (AC) which can be ordered over the phone/internet to come for a pickup at any particular spot for no extra charge. The meter reading starts with INR 27 (About USD 55 cents or about half of one USD). Night fares are 25% extra and are automatically added when the time changes from day to night fare periods.

Three-wheeler auto-rickshaws run in the suburbs of Mumbai outside the central city area beyond Mahim on the Western line and beyond Sion on the Central line. All the rickshaws have an electronic meter from 2013 and the minimum fare is Rs.17 for the first 1.5 km. They seat 3 and have no place to keep luggage except your lap or a small bag behind your seat.

Power supply

Mumbai is a city that never sleeps and always has power. The power grid infrastructure is robust and well planned. Power utility firms such as BEST, Tata Power and Reliance Energy have made extra arrangements to procure more electricity to ensure uninterrupted supply despite heavy demand.

In case of excess demand, a Tata Power official said the firm will source more power from its own generating plants at Trombay and from outside Mumbai to cater to the increasing demand of 6.7 lakh consumers in Mumbai during summer.



Water availability

Mumbai controls several dams in Shahpur taluk (Thane district) that deliver water to the city. The Western Ghats trap most of the moisture laden monsoon clouds which feed these dammed rivers. Currently, these dams deliver approximately 3.4 billion litres of water to Mumbai daily. The water treatment plant in Bhandup, India is the largest and oldest in Asia. Tansa and Vaitarna dams supply the southern region of Mumbai, while the rest supply the suburbs. An underground tank in Malabar Hills is used to store the water. These sources ensure that resident of Mumbai have uninterupted access to water.
