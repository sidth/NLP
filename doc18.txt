In the mid-1990s, university art majors Xu Lai (Xu Zheng) and Yang Yi (Du Juan) fell in love, but then Yang was transferred to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Xu has never seen her since. Almost twenty years later, the already bald Xu has long forgotten his dreams of becoming an artist, but he can never forget Yang even though he enjoys a comfortable life with his loving wife Cai Bo (Zhao Wei), the only major problem between them being the repeated failure conceiving a child.

Of course, this is just a sampling. A creme of the crop, if you will, that will have you in stitches throughout the day if you follow even half of them.

What tickles your funny bone doesn’t matter when you have such a rich library of humor to draw on as Twitter offers. Even if none of the above Twitter accounts trip your trigger (seriously, do you even laugh?), seeing some of the comedic brilliance that they’re retweeting is going to point you in the right direction.

Buoyed by growing anticipation from fans, minor competition and the ever-growing expansion of the Chinese movie industry, Lost in Hong Kong is projected to be a box office success. It made more than half of what its immediate predecessor earned in its entire lifetime in just three days. Critics noted that the film will no doubt surpass its predecessor's US$208 million gross.[6][7][8] It had a worldwide opening of US$106.8 million, which is the second biggest of all time for a comedy film behind The Hangover Part II (US$177.8 million) in 2011, and the biggest for a non-English language film.[9] Its worldwide opening was also the biggest of its release weekend (ahead of Hotel Transylvania 2).[7] Although the film didn't face any serious competition with its fellow new releases during its opening weekend, it started facing competition from new releases—Saving Mr. Wu, Goodbye Mr. Loser, and Chronicles of the Ghostly Tribe—on September 30, 2015 albeit none of them were alble to outgross the former.
