Tropical Depression Ten was a tropical depression of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on August 13 from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 8. As a result of strong wind shear, the depression remained weak and did not strengthen beyond tropical depression status. It degenerated on August 14, although its remnants partially contributed to the formation of the tropical depression which eventually became Hurricane Katrina. Thus, it is generally referred to as "the precursor to Katrina". The cyclone had no effect on land, and did not directly result in any fatalities or damage.

Built in the Soviet Union, in 1993 the luge sports complex closed and about a half year later the track caught on fire.[2] Now the luge track is nonoperational. The sports complex however has a great story as here started out the native of Kiev Natalya Yakushenko[2] who was an Olympian flagbearer for Ukraine at the 2006 Winter Olympics.
